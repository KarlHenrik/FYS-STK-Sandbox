We expect that many of you will encounter some trouble with setting these programs up, as they can be extremely finnicky and prone to not working the same on all machines, so we strongly encourage you to not get discouraged, and to show up to the group-sessions where we can help you along as best we can. The group sessions are also the best place to find group partners for the projects and to be challenged on your understanding of the material, which are both essential to doing well on this course.\n",

    "**a)** Download git if you don't already have it on your machine, check with the terminal command ´git --version´ (https://git-scm.com/downloads).\n",

    "**b)** Create a Github account(https://github.com/), or log in to github with your UiO account (https://github.uio.no/login).\n",

    "**c)** Learn the basics of opening the terminal and navigating folders on your operating system. Things to learn: Opening a terminal, opening a terminal in a specific folder, listing the contents of the current folder, navigating into a folder, navigating out of a folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** Download the Github CLI tool and run ´gh auth login´ in your terminal to authenticate your local machine for some of the later steps. (https://github.com/cli/cli#installation). You might need to change file permissions to make it work, ask us or ChatGPT for help with these issues."

    "There are many ways to manage your packages in Python, and you are free to use any approach you want, but in this course we encourage you to use something called a virtual environment. A virtual environemnt is a folder in your project which contains a Python runtime executable as well as all the packages you are using in the current project. In this way, each of your projects has its required set of packages installed in the same folder, so that if anything goes wrong while managing your packages it only affects the one project, and if multiple projects require different versions of the same package, you don't need to worry about messing up old projects.\n",
