We expect that many of you will encounter some trouble with setting these programs up, as they can be quite finnicky, so we strongly encourage you to not get discouraged, and to show up to the group-sessions where we can help you along as best we can. The group sessions are also the best place to find group partners for the projects and to be challenged on your understanding of the material, which are both essential to doing well on this course.\n",
